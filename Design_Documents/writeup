# Holberston School - What Is Outside - Write Up

## The Design
This end result of this project will be a fully functional single page application with full API integration.

The theme, "What's Outside," is clearly seen in the use of Bob Ross' beautiful outdoor paintings. The application allows the user to filter through Bob Ross' painting tutorials by month, subject, and colors used. Once the desired paintings are rendered, the user can simply click on the card of their choice which will then send them to the youtube tutorial of that specific painting.

## Tools
In creating the backend database for the API, mysql was used in correlation with python, sqlalchemy, and pandas. Data was converted from given files of variouse structures and integrated into sql tables.
Python, Flask, and socketio were used to create the API endpoints, connect to the database, and create the application server.

The frontend tools consisted of javascript, bootstrap, and html/css.
